# Advanced Algorithms

1. Write a program to find the maximum flow in a network using Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm. Augmenting path should be generated using BFS
2. Write a program to find the maximum bipartite matching using Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm. The program should count the number of reassignments carried before the maximum match
3. Implement RSA Algorithm
4. Implement Pattern Matching using i) na√Øve string match ii) Rabin-karp algorithm iii) KMP Algorithm
5 Implement approximation algorithm to solve Travelling Salesman Problem
